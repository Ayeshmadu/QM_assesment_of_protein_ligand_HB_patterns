Dataset analysis part of the paper (Quantum Mechanical Assessment of Protein–Ligand Hydrogen Bond Strength Patterns: Insights from Semiempirical Tight-Binding and Local Vibrational Mode Theory)

## Description 

The paper has been published in the International Journal of Molecular Science under the title Quantum Mechanical Assessment of Protein–Ligand Hydrogen Bond Strength Patterns: Insights from Semiempirical Tight-Binding and Local Vibrational Mode Theory. In this article, we present protein-ligand hydrogen bond relationships using two databases. Here, we present the code snippet of the paper.
